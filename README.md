## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox for layout
- Custom variables and theming
- [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) font family (400, 600, 700)

### What I learned

This project helped me practice how to:

- Build a centered card layout using Flexbox
- Apply CSS variables to manage theme colors
- Implement hover and focus effects for accessibility
- Use a mobile-first responsive approach

#### Example snippet:

```css
ul li button:hover,
ul li button:active {
  color: var(--Grey-700);
  background-color: var(--Green);
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: 0.3s ease-in;
}
```
